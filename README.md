**THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED.** It is not accepting changes.

Cleverbot.py was an unofficial library to access the Cleverbot service before it had a public API.

Cleverbot has since released a new, official API located at https://www.cleverbot.com/api/.

For a Python library wrapping the official API, see https://github.com/edwardslabs/cleverwrap.py.

Thanks for all the love, reverse-engineering, and PRs over the years!
